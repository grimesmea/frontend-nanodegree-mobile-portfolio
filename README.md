## Cameron's Optimized Portfolio
The optimized portfolio can be accessed at http://grimesmea.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-mobile-portfolio/dist/.

Most optimizations to this project were achieved using Gulp (http://gulpjs.com/) in addition to asynchronously running JavaScript when applicable.

Changes to views/js/mains.js to improve FPS and reduce jank on the  http://grimesmea.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-mobile-portfolio/dist/views/pizza page are explained within the comments of main.js.

Source code can be found at https://github.com/grimesmea/frontend-nanodegree-mobile-portfolio/. This code can be downloaded and built (in the same manner as those project files currently available in the /dist folder) following these steps:  
1) Install Node (http://nodejs.org) and Gulp (http://gulpjs.com/)  
2) Install dependencies using npm install - dependencies needed can be seen in
the package.json file.  
3) Run default gulp task  
4) Optimized project files are now available in the /dist folder
